# Managing-Multiple-Environments-Efficiently
Managing multiple environments efficiently (development, staging, production, etc.). Ensuring consistency across these environments can be tricky, but there's a robust solution using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and DevOps practices.


This repository demonstrates how to manage multiple environments (development, staging, production) efficiently using Terraform, Ansible, and Jenkins.

- **Ansible** is used for configuration management.
- **Jenkins** is used to automate the deployment process.
